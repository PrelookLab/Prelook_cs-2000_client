How to create a standalone execution file:

-type in "mcc -m CS2000_startGUI.m" in your command window
-note: no "addpath 'folder'" commands should be in your m-file

-then an CS2000_startGUI.exe and CS2000_startGUI.prj is created

-to add relevant matlab folders containing relevant m-files:
	-double click on CS2000_startGUI.prj
	-chose "add files/directories"
	-When finished click on "Build" (upper right corner of the window)

	-this works much easier than "mcc -m CS2000_startGUI -a ./folder because
	 sometimes matlab has problems to add the folder

-only the CS2000_startGUI.exe is needed for your standalone application
